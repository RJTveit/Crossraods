# Concept

The inspiration for this project came from my youngest sister, who has her own band and loves to perform locally. Crossroads will function as a community hub for users to track their favortie local musicians. Artists can register and post upcoming shows, share rececnt updates, and interact with the community. Venues can register and advertise shows for the public and interact with local artists to schedule events. Users will be able to follow bands and venues, upload photos and posts from concerts, and engage with artists.
